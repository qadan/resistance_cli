The Resistance is a global coalition of freedom fighters. The Resistance was initially created in 1965 as a response to
the growing threat of The Shadow Order. Since then, The Resistance has been in a constant global struggle with The
Shadow Order. The reach and power of The Shadow Order is far greater than that of The Resistance, but our brave agents
fight the good fight regardless.
