The Three Headed Snake refers to an elite team of operatives working for The Shadow Order. One member of the Three
Headed Snake has been reported dead due to the heroic actions of the Beijing Resistance Headquarters. Another member has
been identified, but her location is unknown. The identity and location of the third head is unknown. Speculation and
rumours regarding a possible identity run rampant. The third head is believed to have a connection to the legendary spy
known only as The Snake; however, it is just as likely that the two have no affiliation. The Resistance has been working
diligently to uncover the mystery of the third head.
