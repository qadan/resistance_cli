Virtual Intelligence Tutorial for New Agents
By Ryan W. Haines

Amelia is the newest member of The Resistance. She is a VI program designed to help with data organization and queries.
I have just finished the latest version file, which is now available for all agents of The Resistance.

Amelia’s primary function is to help each agent keep on top of things. You can ask her questions about specific pieces
of information to save time. You no longer have to go to the filing room in the back and dig around for a physical
file – Amelia knows everything! Well, maybe not everything, but I have given her a staggering amount of data so far and
will continue to iterate.

To use Amelia properly, you must phrase your queries in a particular fashion. I will give you some examples.

Example 1)
If I was a new agent and wanted more information about the VI program, I would do the following:
Step 1) Type in: “query Name”
Step 2) Hit the “Enter” key
Step 3) Amelia will respond with all relevant information to the query “Name.” In this case, the “Name” in question
        refers to Amelia.

Please note that ALL queries must start with the phrase, “Ask about” followed by the subject in question.

Example 2)
If I was visiting a foreign Resistance Headquarters and was curious about the status of the HQ, I would do the
following:
Step 1) Type in: “query Status”
Step 2) Hit the “Enter” key
Step 3) Amelia will respond with all relevant information in regards to the status of the current facility.

The above are just two small examples. Try out different things. Amelia knows quite a lot!
